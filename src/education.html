            One of the Open Home Foundation’s core values is that the user owns
            the data that is collected by technology in their home. All the
            technologies we create are made with this principle in mind and are
            champions of privacy: we store user data locally and the user is in
            full control of who has access to this data and what this data is
            used for.

            Home Assistant, and our other technologies like ESPHome, are a
            perfect match to aid your scientific research. Many researchers have
            already harnessed Home Assistant’s power to streamline their
            processes, gain insights, and achieve accurate results.

              Home Assistant is an open source smart home platform with a focus
              on local control and privacy. It is able to connect almost all
              devices in a home, including sensors, HVAC Systems and solar
              panels. Among this is also support for smart home standards

              easy extensibility of Home Assistant also allows for the inclusion
              of devices tailormade for your research, including the ability to
              consume data via

              For each device, Home Assistant keeps a rich history of all the
              available data, and allows the device to be controlled by users or
              automations. This allows you to collect the data to do analysis or
              test advanced algorithms that instantly control systems in
              response to events or collected data.

              Home Assistant is free and open source software that runs on
              almost all platforms. This allows researchers a wide flexibility
              on how to deploy their research. You can leverage an old computer
              to run Home Assistant or buy a $35 Raspberry Pi.

            <p class="text-secondary">
              Home Assistant is an extensible platform. It allows each part of
              the application to be extended or replaced. Researchers are able
              to add support for specific device APIs, pull in data from other
              applications or write advanced algorithms that can act on the fly.
              The user interface is also fully extensible and replaceable. This
              makes it possible to make powerful dashboards to offer insight and
              control, but one can also be more creative and host
              micro-services.

            <p class="text-secondary">
              The Open Home Foundation builds a privacy focused open source
              voice assistant. This voice assistant is built completely modular,
              allowing different speech-to-text, LLMs and text-to-speech engines
              to be used. As part of our focus on privacy, we have also created
              our own text-to-speech engine Piper. Researchers developing novel
              technologies around voice are able to adopt our stack to leverage
              their technologies to see how it behaves in a real world scenario.
