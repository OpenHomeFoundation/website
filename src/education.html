            One of the Open Home Foundation’s core values is that the user owns the data that is collected by technology in their home. All the technologies we create are made with this principle in mind and are champions of privacy: we store user data locally and the user is in full control of who has access to this data and what this data is used for.
          </p>
          <p class="text-center mb-24">
            Home Assistant, and our other technologies like ESPHome, are a perfect match to aid your scientific research. Many researchers have already harnessed Home Assistant’s power to streamline their processes, gain insights, and achieve accurate results.

          <h2 class="text-center mb-48">Why use Open Home technologies in research?</h2>
          <ul class="mb-24">
            <li><strong>Integrate all the things:</strong> Home Assistant is an open source smart home platform with a focus on local control and privacy. It is able to connect almost all devices in a home, including sensors, HVAC Systems and solar panels. Among this is also support for smart home standards <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha">Zigbee</a>, <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zwave_js">Z-Wave</a> and <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/matter">Matter</a>, which gives access to a wide range of affordable devices. The easy extensibility of Home Assistant also allows for the inclusion of devices tailormade for your research, including the ability to consume data via <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt">MQTT</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Powerful APIs:</strong> Home Assistant offers access to all events, information and control via a real-time <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/websocket">WebSocket API</a>. You can tap into this to collect the data to do analysis on the rich and granular collected data or create advanced algorithms that control systems in real time in response to events or collected data. If you rather take a daily snapshot of your collected data, you can easily access the underlying SQLite database and <a href="https://data.home-assistant.io/docs/data">explore its contents</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Deployability:</strong> Home Assistant is free and open source software that runs on almost all platforms. This allows researchers a wide flexibility on how to deploy their research. You can leverage an old computer to run Home Assistant or buy a $35 Raspberry Pi.</li>
            <li><strong>Extensibility:</strong> Home Assistant is an extensible platform. It allows each part of the application to be extended or replaced. Researchers are able to add support for specific device APIs, pull in data from other applications or write advanced algorithms that can act on the fly. The user interface is also fully extensible and replaceable. This makes it possible to make powerful dashboards to offer insight and control, but one can also be more creative and host micro-services.</li>
            <li><strong>Voice and AI:</strong> The Open Home Foundation builds a privacy focused open source voice assistant. This voice assistant is built completely modular, allowing different speech-to-text, LLMs and text-to-speech engines to be used. As part of our focus on privacy, we have also created our own text-to-speech engine Piper. Researchers developing novel technologies around voice are able to adopt our stack to leverage their technologies to see how it behaves in a real world scenario.</li>

            <p><strong>Email from Swiss PhD student</strong></p>
            <p>My name is Luka Nenadic and I am a Ph.D. Student at ETH Zurich’s Center for Law & Economics. As one of my research projects, I am trying to develop a research question related to the European Union’s new Data Act, which, in short, “gives individuals and businesses the right to access the data produced through their utilisation of smart objects, machines and devices” (European Commission, 2024). The regulation will become applicable in September 2025.</p>
            <p>Against this backdrop, I was thinking that it would be very insightful to talk to the providers of a leading open source home automation tool. Most importantly, it would be really interesting for me to know whether you even expect any meaningful impact from the Data Act and, if yes, where you would expect the biggest changes that a researcher may want to inspect.</p>
            <p>Please let me know if you are interested in having a conversation.</p>
            <p>Best,</p>
