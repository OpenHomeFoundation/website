            The Open Home Foundation is a tax-exempt, non-profit
            <i>Stiftung</i> based in Switzerland. It is funded by commercial
            partner fees and donations. The foundation has no financial
            obligation to its partners. Funding and support flow in a single
            direction: from partners to the Open Home Foundation.<br /><br />
            Commercial partners, however, are allowed to create products that
            license Open Home Foundation brands. They may also collaborate with
            Open Home Foundation employees to ensure general interoperability,
            and alignment with the foundation’s guiding principles. Apollo
            Automation and Nabu Casa are the Open Home Foundation’s current
            commercial partners. Each is contractually required to contribute a
            majority of its revenue to supporting the Open Home Foundation.<br /><br />
            This funding allows the Open Home Foundation to support more than 50
            full-time employees, collaborate on external projects, and make
            donations to causes consistent with its principles.

        <div class="question col-s-12 col-m-5">
          <p>Why this structure, and why Switzerland?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer col-s-12 col-m-7">
          <p>
            How best to support the future of the open home was a question
            without a definitive answer. Our founders looked for inspiration
            from other organizations defending our digital rights. They
            eventually settled on moving ownership of projects to a non-profit
            Stiftung (“foundation”) supported by for- and non-profit partners.
            For a low-overhead, international organization like ours, this
            structure represented the best chance to accomplish the foundation’s
            goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our founding board chose to locate the Open Home Foundation in
            Switzerland because of the country’s strict adherence to the rule of
            law, long history supporting privacy and democracy, and fierce
            political independence. Switzerland is forward-looking when it comes
            to intellectual property, reverse-engineering, and the use of APIs
            for interoperability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Are there other models, and other countries, which would have
            worked? Of course! But after long consideration we believe we made
            the right choices to pull off this pretty radical, pretty idealistic
            project.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="grid mb-48">
        <div class="question col-s-12 col-m-5">
          <p>
            Does a partner profit when I buy something from it—even if all I
            care about is supporting the Open Home Foundation?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer col-s-12 col-m-7">
          <p>Yes. Absolutely.</p>
          <p>
            This is one of the compromises involved in the structure we’ve
            chosen, the size of our organization, and the rules that pertain to
            how we are allowed to handle funding.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of Nabu Casa, our inaugural partner, this isn’t a
            significant change from how things worked before the creation of the
            Open Home Foundation. It only formalizes the relationship. Newer
            partners, like Apollo Automation, have the same obligations. 
          </p>
          <p>
            (And hey, if you’re still not sure you want to support a for-profit
            partner to support us—don’t. Contribute directly to one of our
            projects, or a project that matches our smart home ideals—or yours!
            That’s totally in line with our ethos. This idea is bigger than just
            us. Or any single project.)
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="grid mb-48">
        <div class="question col-s-12 col-m-5">
          <p>Is Nabu Casa’s relationship to the Open Home Foundation unique?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer col-s-12 col-m-7">
          <p>Short answer: No.</p>
          <p>Longer answer: Mainly in terms of its track record.</p>
          <p>
            Nabu Casa is a for-profit company. But since it was founded in 2018
            by some of the same people now involved with the Open Home
            Foundation, it has stewarded the cause of Home Assistant without
            commercializing the open source project itself. For years, a
            significant portion of Nabu Casa’s revenue was used to pay the
            salaries of people working on numerous open source, open
            home-aligned projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            This relationship changed slightly in 2024 when Home Assistant and
            other projects were transferred to the Open Home Foundation. Nabu
            Casa became a partner to the Open Home Foundation, contributing a
            majority of its revenue to the foundation. In 2025, every employee
            working on the foundation projects moved from Nabu Casa to the Open
            Home Foundation.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="grid mb-48">
        <div class="question col-s-12 col-m-5">
          <p>Will there be additional partners?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer col-s-12 col-m-7">
          <p>We hope so!</p>
          <p>
            At the end of 2025, Apollo Automation became the second commercial
            partner of the Open Home Foundation, adding diversity and
            sustainability to our cause. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We continue to welcome other organizations with a proven track
            record, and a willingness to commit their resources, to consider
            partnering with the Open Home Foundation.
