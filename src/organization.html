          <p class="text-secondary">
            The Open Home Foundation, and the projects it owns, are directly
            supported by partner fees, and additional resources provided by its
            inaugural partner, Nabu Casa. Because we are registered as a
            non-profit eingetragener Verein (“registered association”) in
            Switzerland,
            <strong
              >we are democratically organized—and cannot be primarily driven by
              economic interests</strong
            >. <br /><br />
            In simple terms, this means we are limited in the money we can
            accept, and how we can use it.
            <br /><br />
            As a result, we are not organized to accept small donations.
            Instead, the board of the Open Home Foundation determines how
            partner fees and non-financial resources, like sponsoring full-time
            contributors and providing IT infrastructure, are directed in
            support of both foundation-owned and external projects. Right now,
            the Open Home Foundation has a single partner, Nabu Casa. Continuing
            on a strong track record of support for the concepts of the open
            home and open-source, Nabu Casa currently employs over 30 people,
            most of whom work full-time on Open Home Foundation projects and
            collabs.
            <br /><br />
            For instance, instead of a future partner directly giving money to
            the Open Home Foundation, our board could secure an agreement for
            that partner to pay the full-time salary of someone working on what
            we think is a critical smart home project, such as the open-source
            Z-Wave JS library.

              Casa’s partnership fee, and pays the salaries of people working on

        <div class="question col-s-12 col-m-5">
          <p>Why this structure, and why Switzerland?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer col-s-12 col-m-7">
          <p>
            How best to support the future of the open home was a question
            without a definitive answer. Our founders looked for inspiration
            from organizations like the Mozilla Foundation, Electronic Frontier
            Foundation, Signal Foundation, and others. They eventually settled
            on moving ownership of projects to a non-profit eingetragener Verein
            (“registered association”) supported by for- and non-profit
            partners. For a low-overhead, international organization like ours,
            this structure represented the best chance to accomplish the
            foundation’s goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our founding board chose to locate the Open Home Foundation in
            Switzerland because of the country’s strict adherence to the rule of
            law, long history supporting privacy and democracy, and fierce
            political independence. Switzerland is forward-looking when it comes
            to intellectual property, reverse-engineering, and the use of APIs
            for interoperability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Are there other models, and other countries, which would have
            worked? Of course! But after long consideration we believe we made
            the right choices to pull off this pretty radical, pretty idealistic
            project.
          </p>

      <div class="grid mb-48">
        <div class="question col-s-12 col-m-5">
          <p>
            Does a partner profit when I buy something from them—even if all I
            care about is supporting the Open Home Foundation?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer col-s-12 col-m-7">
          <p>Yes. Absolutely.</p>
          <p>
            This is one of the compromises involved in the structure we’ve
            chosen, the size of our organization, and the rules that pertain to
            how we are allowed to handle funding.

            In the case of Nabu Casa, our inaugural partner, this isn’t a
            significant change from how things worked before the creation of the
            Open Home Foundation. It only formalizes the relationship.

        <div class="question col-s-12 col-m-5">
          <p>Is Nabu Casa’s relationship to the Open Home Foundation unique?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer col-s-12 col-m-7">
          <p>
            Mainly in terms of its track record. And as the inaugural partner of
            the Open Home Foundation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nabu Casa is a for-profit company. But since it was founded in 2018
            by some of the same people involved with the Open Home Foundation,
            it has stewarded the cause of Home Assistant without commercializing
            the open-source project itself. For years, a significant portion of
            Nabu Casa’s revenue has been used to pay the salaries of people
            working on numerous open-source, open home-aligned projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            What’s new is that the Open Home Foundation now officially owns Home
            Assistant—and Nabu Casa, as an Open Home Foundation partner, is
            required to contribute funding and non-financial resources to the
            foundation.
          </p>

      <div class="grid mb-48">
        <div class="question col-s-12 col-m-5">
          <p>Will there be other partners?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer col-s-12 col-m-7">
          <p>
            Nabu Casa is the first partner of the Open Home Foundation, but
            hopefully not the last. We welcome other organizations with a proven
            track record, and the willingness to commit their resources, to
            consider partnering with Open Home Foundation.

            (And hey, if you’re still not sure you want to support one of our
            for-profit partners to support us—don’t. Contribute directly to one
            of our projects, or a project that matches our smart home ideals—or
            yours! That’s totally in line with our ethos. This idea is bigger
            than just us. Or any single project.)
