            Thanks for taking the time to share your experiences with us. The Open Home Foundation (CHE-416.988.952),
            c/o Treforma AG, Grabenstrasse 25, 6340 Baar, Switzerland (OHF) is eager to conduct research to learn more
            about people's experiences, desires or concerns regarding the use of technology at homes. To do this, OHF
            may among other things and depending on the research activity, conduct interviews that will be recorded or
            ask participants to share notes, pictures or short sketches.

          <p class="text-center mb-24">
            In each research activity, we will ask you about your personal experience. There are no wrong answers. All
            your thoughts, wishes, and concerns are valuable to us. If interviews are conducted between OHF and you as
            part of the research activity in question, these will be recorded in audio and video.

          <p class="text-center mb-24">
            Participation in any research activities is entirely voluntary and will not be compensated. You may take a
            break or terminate your participation at any time without giving a reason. You may also withdraw from any
            research activities after your participation. OHF needs to be informed of any such withdrawal. Personal
            information that has at that time already been provided to OHF may without a contrary remark continue to be
            processed.
          </p>
          <p class="text-center mb-48">
            <strong>If you participate in the study, your personal data is processed.</strong> We process the data you provide us with,
            such as your name, email address, the audio and video recordings and your answers to our questions,
            including information about your smart home. Participation in such research by OHF is open to anyone over
            the age of 18. If you are younger, you must have your parent or guardianâ€™s consent and they must supervise
            your participation in any research activity of OHF. OHF has the right to exclude your participation at any
            time without giving a reason.

            activities in connection with this Agreement.
            When you provide us with information, we will use it in the ways for which you've given us permission. In
            general, we use your information to enhance our understanding of users and improve the design of Open Home

            We will take necessary and appropriate precautions to protect your personal information. Any transcriptions
            of the research activities will not be associated with your name. Research records and raw data are stored
            in secure files that can only be accessed by members of OHF. We will store and process your personal
            information and session data in accordance with the applicable law, including the <strong>Swiss Federal Act on Data
            Protection (FADP)</strong>, the <strong>Ordinance to the Federal Act on Data Protection (OFADP)</strong> and the <strong>General Data

            In order to carry out the research activities described in this Agreement, it is necessary to share your
            personal data with third parties (such as service providers, IT services and research partners). The
            disclosure of personal data is limited to selected third-party service providers and only to the extent
            necessary for the optimal provision of our services. Furthermore, your data may be disclosed, especially to
            authorities or legal advisors, if we are legally obliged to do so or if it is necessary to protect our
            rights, in particular to enforce claims arising from our relationship with you. The legal basis for this
            data processing is our legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR in protecting
            our rights and fulfilling our obligations.
          </p>
          <p class="text-center mb-24">
            We have the right to transfer your personal data to third parties located abroad if it is necessary to carry
            out the data processing described in this Agreement. When making such transfers, we will ensure compliance
            with the applicable legal requirements for disclosing personal data to third parties (such as the conclusion
            of data processing agreements with the service providers and implementing standard contractual clauses).
          </p>
          <p class="text-center mb-48">
            The raw data and any personal information provided will be stored until we deem the content no longer
            necessary for the research purposes of the activity you were involved in and any legal retention
            requirements have been met. The data will be deleted or anonymized as soon as there is no longer any legal
            obligation to retain it and no legitimate interest in its retention exists or if you withdraw your consent.
