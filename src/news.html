              We created the Open Home Foundation to fight for the fundamental
              principles of <strong>privacy</strong>, <strong>choice</strong>,
              and <strong>sustainability</strong> for smart homes. And every
              person who lives in one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ahead of today, we’ve transferred over 240 projects, standards,
              drivers, and libraries—Home Assistant, ESPHome, ZigPy, Piper,
              Improv Wifi, Wyoming, and so many more—to the Open Home
              Foundation. This is all about looking into the future. We’ve done
              this to create a bulwark against surveillance capitalism, the risk
              of buyout, and open-source projects becoming abandonware. To an
              extent, this protection extends even against our future selves—so
              that smart home users can continue to benefit for years, if not
              decades. No matter what comes.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the work of the Open Home Foundation doesn’t stop there.
              Through close partnership with Nabu Casa, the foundation funds,
              directs resources to, and collaborates on the development of
              critical external projects from the smart home ecosystem, like
              Z-Wave JS, WLED, Rhasspy, and Zigbee2MQTT. Our main requirements
              are that the projects remain open to everyone, and aligned with
              our core principles.
            </p>
            <p>This is what we’ve already done.</p>
            <h2>Our ambitions go further.</h2>
            <p>
              Our aim is to have the resources to be an active political
              advocate. Serving to educate the public, and public servants, and
              the companies making smart home devices and services, about the
              importance of open standards, open-source projects, and privacy,
              choice, and sustainability when it comes to the future of smart
              homes.
            </p>
            <p>Here’s how we understand these principles:</p>
            <h3>Our ambitions go further.</h3>
            <p>
              Privacy means you control your data. Nobody, and no company or
              organization has a right to know what you do in your home, with
              whom you meet or associate, or how you choose to live without your
              explicit permission. You should only share this information if you
              freely make the choice to do so without external pressure. That’s
              why your devices need to work locally. It’s OK for a product to
              offer a cloud connection—but its main functionality should work
              without the cloud. And the use of cloud services should always be
              opt-in and clearly described.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should never have to worry about being yourself to avoid being
              tracked or classified by an algorithm. You should be able to live
              your life—because nobody is watching.
            </p>
            <h3>Choice</h3>
            <p>
              Choice means you have the freedom to use any device, with any
              other, from any manufacturers, any way you like—for as long as you
              want. To make this possible, vendors must not arbitrarily limit
              the interoperability of their devices with the rest of your smart
              home. Control of those devices, and management of data they
              gather, should operate via open standards and local APIs.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should be able to design your personal smart home—the way you
              imagine it.
            </p>
            <h3>Sustainability</h3>
            <p>
              Sustainability means being able to use and repurpose old
              appliances, smart devices, and other durable hardware beyond
              commercially-limited lifetimes as your smart home evolves. But it
              also means having the tools to limit your environmental impact by
              tracking, automating, and reducing waste and emissions.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should be able to embrace the convenience of a smart home
              without compromising your ability to cut utility bills—and your
              carbon footprint.
            </p>

            <h3>Getting here didn’t follow a linear path.</h3>
            <p>
              As many people in this community already know, the Home Assistant
              Journey started over 10 years ago when Paulus Schoutsen wrote a
              few lines of Python to take control of his Philips Hue smart
              lights. His motivation was greater control over the devices he’d
              purchased—rather than letting a corporate giant decide what was
              best for his home.
            </p>
            <p>
              This act struck such a chord that over the coming years, thousands
              of mostly volunteer contributors transformed that first script
              into a leading smart home platform. They also built an entire
              ecosystem of projects around it.
            </p>
            <p>
              But two other critical trends also took place, one far more
              troubling: The smart home landscape grew dominated by companies
              whose purpose was to sell you new devices on a schedule to please
              their shareholders—while siphoning off your personal data for
              financial gain.
            </p>
            <p>
              The other trend was Schoutsen and others approaching burn-out as
              they tried to keep their various projects thriving—doing most of
              their coding after coming home from their real jobs, on weekends,
              and when bugs needed squashing.
            </p>
            <p>
              To address this, Schoutsen, Ben Bangert, and Pascal Vizeli founded
              Nabu Casa in 2018 as a for-profit company. The goal was to
              stabilize Home Assistant, and bolster its longevity, by injecting
              predictable funding for future development. Nabu Casa also bought
              ESPHome, with the same purpose in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              Early on, some people questioned whether starting a for-profit
              company was an altruistic move. But over the following years, Nabu
              Casa established a clear and accountable track record. This
              included putting its money where its stakeholder’s mouths were:
              Speaking up to protect open-source ideals when other developers
              came under threat; directing full-time employees to devote their
              days to open-source, community-driven, smart home projects; and
              joining organizations like the Connectivity Standards Alliance and
              Z-Wave Alliance, and the general fight for critical open standards
              like Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Matter.
            </p>
            <p>
              By 2021, Schoutsen and others defined a concept called the open
              home, built around the principles of privacy, choice, and
              sustainability. But Home Assistant and other open home projects
              were still floating in a kind of undefined space between a
              for-profit entity and an open-source repository on Github.
            </p>
            <p>
              So in 2023, this core group of smart home developers decided to
              codify and protect their ideals. And to create a formal home for
              the projects they and so many other contributors had poured their
              souls, beliefs, and shared code into.
            </p>
            <p>
              Individual efforts needed to be united. And in 2024, the Open Home
              Foundation was created to unite them—with a special, rules-bound,
              inaugural partner in Nabu Casa to provide the majority of the
              funding.
            </p>

              threads of DNA that represent our past.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’ve always stood for open-source, creativity, and taking
              initiative. And we have no doubt that this organization will
              evolve over the years. We will remain true to our principles of
              privacy, choice, and sustainability for the smart home. And always
              open to finding the best way to achieve our goals.
            </p>
