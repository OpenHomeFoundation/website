            The <strong>Open Home Foundation</strong> fights for the fundamental
            principles of <strong>privacy</strong>, <strong>choice</strong>, and
            <strong>sustainability</strong> for smart homes. And for every
            person who lives in one. It does this by supporting the development
            of open-source projects, and open connectivity and communication
            standards.

              Share only what you want. With whom you want. Without modifying
              your behavior because of an algorithm. To ensure privacy, smart
              home devices must work locally, and cloud services must be
              optional and opt-in.

              Across manufacturers. Without vendor lock-in, or arbitrary
              barriers to interoperability. To ensure user choice, devices and
              the management of data they gather should operate via open
              standards and local APIs.

              And reduce your environmental impact. To ensure sustainability,
              devices must be built for durability, open to modification, and
              part of a system providing tools to track, automate, and reduce
              waste and emissions.

            Thanks to funding by partners like <strong>Nabu Casa</strong>, we
            also collaborate on external member projects that align with our
            principles. These include Z-Wave JS, WLED, Rhasspy, and Zigbee2MQTT.
            <br /><br />
            In the future, we aim to play a greater role as political advocates
            for smart home privacy, choice, and sustainability.
