          <p class="text-center mb-48"><em>Version January 8, 2026</em></p>
          <p class="text-center mb-24">
            We're currently hard at work building the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org">Open Home
              Foundation</a> device database, a real-world, actionable list of smart home devices – focusing on device
            model, manufacturer, features, software, interoperability, and other specs you've told us are most important
            to you. Ideally, it will greatly reduce the time you need to research future smart home purchases.
          </p>
          <p class="text-center mb-24">
            But to create the most comprehensive, globally inclusive database of devices we need your help understanding
            what devices your smart home uses, and how they are integrated. As a result, we've created a quick and easy
            (opt-in) way for you to contribute by automatically uploading smart home device information directly from
            your <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io">Home Assistant</a> instance.
          </p>
          <p class="text-center mb-24">
            That said, we refuse to ever compromise when it comes to your fundamental right to privacy. At the Open Home
            Foundation, this means more than a checkbox. We want you to feel safe because you know exactly what
            information we have access to, what we will do with it, and how you can opt in and opt out at any time –
            exactly in line with the views described in our <a
              href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=18Bw8P2Wxr0uWgcqLAf4TfH6aMOmcgw0q">position paper on Privacy in the
              smart home</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="text-center mb-24">
            So before you get involved, here's how we protect your privacy (consistent with our <a
              href="https://analytics.home-assistant.io">Home Assistant analytics</a> approach):
          </p>
          <ol class="mb-24">
            <li><strong>You are in control (opt-in):</strong> This feature will be <strong>strictly opt-in</strong>. You
              must give explicit permission for your Home Assistant instance to send device information to the database.
              You can opt-out again at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>We will not use personally identifiable information:</strong> We will not use or further process
              any personally identifiable data. We only care about the information that describes a device, including
              things like the manufacturer, model, and software version used to potentially deduct insights to be shared
              to the public.</li>
            <li><strong>Data will be aggregated:</strong> The information sent will be <strong>aggregated</strong>,
              meaning that data from multiple Home Assistant instances will be combined to build the database.
              Consequently, no individual submissions are added to the database but only aggregated ones once certain
              thresholds have been reached (e.g. a minimum number of 10 independent device submissions).</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="text-center mb-48">
            We are building this database as a communal effort – by and for our community – to become a foundational
            resource for the smart home ecosystem. We are committed to ensuring its integrity remains independent of
            commercial influence, and that your privacy is protected at every step of the way. For more information on
            our <em>guiding principles</em> please <a

          <p class="text-center mb-24">
            We want to ensure that the device database accurately reflects real-world smart homes. Hereby, the integrity
            and authenticity of the device database depends on data from actual Home Assistant users. By combining
            numerous submissions for each device, we can establish an objective, non-biased validation process.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-8"><strong>Our guidelines for including submitted data to the database:</strong></p>
          <ul class="mb-48">
            <li>Generally, no individual submissions are added to the database</li>
            <li>Instead, the database considers the <strong>aggregate</strong> (or combined total) of multiple
              submissions</li>
            <li>A device will only be included if this combined data <strong>meets certain thresholds</strong>, like a
              valid amount of individual submissions for the same device</li>

          <p class="text-center mb-24">
            The device database is securely hosted in one of Amazon Web Services (AWS) European availability zones.
          </p>
          <p class="text-center mb-24">
            To ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data we receive we are splitting the device database in two
            main focus areas, or "zones":
          </p>
          <p class="mb-8"><strong>Staging zone</strong></p>
          <p class="mb-24">
            This is where your submitted device data resides until it passes checks to ensure authenticity and integrity
            before being aggregated and moved to the live zone for general availability.
            Hereby, we are using two kinds of (random) identifiers:
          </p>
          <ul class="mb-24">
            <li><em>Submission identifier</em>: Unique for each submission</li>
            <li><em>Submitter identifier</em>: Unique for each submitter</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mb-24">
            Your submission data is stored for a maximum of 60 days since the last update.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-8"><strong>Live zone</strong></p>
          <p class="mb-24">
            Only contains aggregates of the submitted snapshots with staging-zone and identifiers removed. Data in the
            live zone will be publicly accessible for full transparency.
          </p>
          <p class="text-center mb-48">
            We do not knowingly collect and we do not retain any personal data. Aggregated, non-personal, live zone data

            Once you actively opt-in to contributing to the device database via the setting in the Analytics section in
            your Home Assistant Companion app or web interface (via <em>Settings > Analytics > Device Analytics</em>),
            your Home Assistant instance will automatically upload a snapshot of your device information.
          </p>
          <p class="text-center mb-24">
            This process then repeats daily to help keep the database up to date. Any changes, including new devices you

          <p class="text-center mb-48">
            "Opting out" means you can change your mind and stop contributing device data at any time, for any reason.

            This is a key point: We cannot automatically delete your past contributions because <strong>we have no way
              of knowing which data is yours.</strong> This is due to the fact that no individual submissions are
            included in the database – only aggregated information. Furthermore, before a submission is considered to be
            included in the database it needs to hit certain thresholds, like a minimum amount of 10 individual
            submissions for the same device.

          <p class="text-center mb-24">
            At the moment of submission we use a random ID to identify which devices are submitted from a single

          </p>
          <p class="text-center mb-48">
            We envision a future where everybody can use the device database to gain insights and access its data. For
            example, your Home Assistant instance could query our database to search for compatible or commonly combined
            devices. If we implement such a system it will be your instance that accesses the public database – neither
            the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org">Open Home Foundation</a> nor the device database will store
            or record any information coming from your instance based on such a query.

          <p class="text-center mb-24">
            We understand that integrations can sometimes mix personal data with device information, like "Sharon's
            iPhone 17". The submission process for the device database is explicitly designed to handle this risk and
            actively protect your privacy.
          </p>
          <p class="text-center mb-24">
            First, we attempt to exclude any information that is not device-centric. Your submissions are based on
            unique Model IDs, and we do not ask your instance for any field that could contain an email, name, location,
            or other identifier.
          </p>
          <p class="text-center mb-24">
            Second, as an extra layer of protection, we actively scan all submissions to find and remove any personal
            information in common formats, like email addresses that have passed our first screening. This ensures that
            sensitive data is scrubbed before it ever enters the database.
          </p>
          <p class="text-center mb-48">
            If you ever feel that some personal information may have been exposed, we urge you to contact us (<a
