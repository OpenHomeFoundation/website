            A home is a sanctuary. A place of refuge. A place free from
            danger—and free from prying eyes. A home is where you can be
            yourself without compromising your data, your ideals, your behavior,
            or your independence.

        The Open Home Foundation’s projects, support, and advocacy stand in
        stark contrast to the smart home alternative driven by surveillance
        capitalism. You should never be the product—whether the products or
        services you use are free or paid.

          <p>
            We have created a bulwark against surveillance capitalism, the risk
            of buyout, and open-source projects becoming abandonware. The Open
            Home Foundation has done this by taking ownership of over <strong>240 smart
            home projects, standards, drivers, and libraries.</strong> For the people and
            organizations who have transferred projects to the Open Home
            Foundation, this protection even extends against their future
            selves—so that smart home users will continue to benefit for years,
            if not decades. No matter what the future brings.
          <br/><br/>
            But the work of the Open Home Foundation doesn’t stop there. Through
            close partnership with <strong>Nabu Casa</strong>, the foundation funds, directs
            resources to, and collaborates on the development of external
            projects that can be used by anyone, like Z-Wave JS, WLED, Rhasspy,
            and Zigbee2MQTT.

          <p>
            The Open Home Foundation aims to one day have the resources to be an active political advocate. We aim to educate the public and public servants, and the companies making smart home devices and services, about the value of open standards, open-source projects, and privacy, choice, and sustainability when it comes to the future of smart homes.
